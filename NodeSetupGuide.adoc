### Minimum System Requirements
Below are the minimum system requirements to run a PocketNet node to use as a wallet, for coin staking to earn PKOIN, and to use as a local node on your home network.  A node with these requirements may need to be upgraded within the next 1 - 2 years.

2 core CPU

4GB RAM

100 GB harddrive

10 Mbps internet connection

### Recommended System Requirements
The below recommended system requirements are recommended for a node which will act as a public node to service the Bastyon front end, in addition to wallet and coin staking abilities.  The recommended requirements should provide enough headroom to support the Pocketnet network for at least 2 years into the future.

4 core CPU

16 GB RAM

500 GB SSD Harddrive

100 Mbps internet connection

Publically accessible IP and ports (see Network Setup below)

### Linux Getting Started  (Ubuntu, Debian, Mint, etc.)

Download the latest pocketnetcore_*_linux_x64_setup package from the project releases page at: https://github.com/pocketnetteam/pocketnet.core/releases

Install package with root privilegies. To do this, open the terminal in the directory where you downloaded the installer and execute commands:
```
$ sudo dpkg -i pocketnetcore_*_linux_x64_setup.deb
```

Download and copy the checkpoints file from the repository to the .pocketcoin/checkpoints directory (example below for version v0.20.17):
```
mkdir ~/.pocketcoin
mkdir ~/.pocketcoin/checkpoints
cd ~/.pocketcoin/checkpoints
wget https://github.com/pocketnetteam/pocketnet.core/releases/download/v0.20.17/main.sqlite3
cd ~
```


After installation, start the GUI pocketcoin client from the command line.  If you would like to run the pocketcoin node from the command line or in headless mode, go to the "Running a Headless Node from the Command Line" section below.
```
$ pocketcoin-qt
```
At this point the Pocketcoin client will start synchornizing with the network.  Depending on network performance full synchronization can take anywhere from a few days to over a week to complete.  It is recommended to allow the node to fully sync with the network the first time 

If it is desired to run a full node to support the Bastyon front-end app, proceed to the Network Setup section below.

### Getting Started with Staking

Staking is the process where your node works to generate new blocks on the PocketNet blockchain, and in return is rewarded with PKOIN awards.  New blocks are generated on the PocketNet blockchain every 1 minute, and 5 PKOIN is awarded to a winning node each round.  A stake reward halving occurs every 2 million blocks, the first on the PocketNet network will occur around October of 2022, after which the stake reward will be reduced to 2.5 coins per block.
To participate in staking, you must deposit at least 50 PKOIN to your node wallet address and ensure.  The more PKOIN desposited to your wallet address, the better your chances of winning a stake round, up to a cap of 10000 PKOIN.

Running the "getstakinginfo" command from pocketcoin-cli or the debug window of Pocketcoin-qt will tell you if your node is staking, for example:

```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-53-18:~/.pocketcoin$ pocketcoin-cli getstakinginfo
{
  "enabled": true,
  "staking": true,
  "errors": "",
  "currentblockweight": 63528,
  "currentblocktx": 52,
  "difficulty": 228206.0349124698,
  "search-interval": 16,
  "weight": 2305157068183,
  "balance": 2305157068183,
  "netstakeweight": 272146840647277,
  "expectedtime": 17708
}
```

If the "enabled" and "staking" fields are set to "true" the node is actively staking.  The "expectedtime" field above gives the estimated time in seconds until the next stake win.  Stake wins are based on chance and can be highly variable.  The first time a node is setup for staking, it may take several hours for the "enabled" and "staking" fields to show up as "true".
